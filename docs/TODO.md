## TODO

### Teacher Dashboard - Next Pedagogical Layer
- Add a `Behöver stöd nu` panel with ranked students and clear reason codes.
- Add risk flags per student (high error + low reasonability + low activity).
- Add assignment adherence metric (did student work on assigned mode/level).
- Add per-operation bottleneck view by `skillTag`/level where student stalls.
- Add quick actions from row:
  - assign focused repetition by operation/level range
  - assign short confidence warmup
  - assign mixed challenge set
- Simplify overlapping percentages in table and keep table as drilldown.

### Teacher Workflow
- Add inactivity buckets (not active today, 2+ days, 7+ days).
- Add class-level summaries: started/not started, weekly completion.
- Add export for class snapshot (CSV).
